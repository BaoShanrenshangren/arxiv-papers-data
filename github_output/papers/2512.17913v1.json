  "abstract": "arXiv:2512.17913v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled sophisticated multi-agent architectures for healthcare, where large language models power collaborative clinical decision-making. However, these distributed systems face critical challenges in ensuring message integrity and fault tolerance when operating in adversarial or untrusted environments.This paper presents a novel Byzantine fault-tolerant multi-agent system specifically designed for healthcare applications, integrating gossip-based message propagation with cryptographic validation mechanisms. Our system employs specialized AI agents for diagnosis, treatment planning, emergency response, and data analysis, coordinated through a Byzantine consensus protocol that tolerates up to f faulty nodes among n = 3f + 1 total nodes. We implement a gossip protocol for decentralized message dissemination, achieving consensus with 2f + 1 votes while maintaining system operation even under Byzantine failures. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully validates medical messages with cryptographic signatures, prevents replay attacks through timestamp validation, and maintains consensus accuracy of 100% with up to 33% Byzantine nodes. The system provides real-time visualization of consensus rounds, vote tallies, and network topology, enabling transparent monitoring of fault-tolerant operations. This work contributes a practical framework for building secure, resilient healthcare multi-agent systems capable of collaborative medical decision-making in untrusted environments.",
