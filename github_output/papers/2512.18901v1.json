  "abstract": "arXiv:2512.18901v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present Gabliteration, a novel neural weight modification technique that advances beyond traditional abliteration methods by implementing adaptive multi-directional projections with regularized layer selection. Our approach addresses the fundamental limitation of existing methods that compromise model quality while attempting to modify specific behavioral patterns. Through dynamic layer optimization, regularized projection matrices, and adaptive scaling mechanisms, we achieve theoretically superior weight modification while minimizing quality degradation in unrelated domains. We validate our method through the gabliterated-v1 model series (0.6B to 4B parameters) available on Hugging Face, demonstrating practical applicability across multiple model scales.",
