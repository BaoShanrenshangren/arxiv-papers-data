  "abstract": "arXiv:2512.17956v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Safety alignment can make frontier LMs overly conservative, degrading collaboration via hedging or false refusals. We present a lightweight toolkit with three parts: (1) Victor Calibration (VC), a multi-pass protocol that elicits a scalar confidence proxy T (T0<T2) through iterative evidence re-evaluation; (2) FD-Lite, a behavior-only phenomenology audit with a fixed anchor phrase and a meta-prefix trap to avoid anthropomorphic claims; and (3) CP4.3, a governance stress test for rank invariance and allocation monotonicity (M6). Across Claude 4.5 models (Haiku, Sonnet no-thinking, Sonnet thinking) and Opus, we observe monotonic VC trajectories without violating safety invariants, and stable CP4.3 behavior. (\"Opus\" here refers to a single Claude Opus 4.1 session accessed via a standard UI account, as reported in Table 1.) This work was conducted by a single operator (n=1) and is intended as hypothesis-generating; we explicitly invite replication, critique, and extension by the research community. We include prompt templates and an artifact plan to facilitate independent verification.",
