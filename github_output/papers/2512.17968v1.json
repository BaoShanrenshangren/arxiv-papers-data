  "abstract": "arXiv:2512.17968v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Monte Carlo algorithms are a foundational pillar of modern computational science, yet their effective application hinges on a deep understanding of their performance trade offs. This paper presents a critical analysis of the evolution of Monte Carlo algorithms, focusing on the persistent tension between statistical efficiency and computational cost. We describe the historical development from the foundational Metropolis Hastings algorithm to contemporary methods like Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. A central emphasis of this survey is the rigorous discussion of time and space complexity, including upper, lower, and asymptotic tight bounds for each major algorithm class. We examine the specific motivations for developing these methods and the key theoretical and practical observations such as the introduction of gradient information and adaptive tuning in HMC that led to successively better solutions. Furthermore, we provide a justification framework that discusses explicit situations in which using one algorithm is demonstrably superior to another for the same problem. The paper concludes by assessing the profound significance and impact of these algorithms and detailing major current research challenges.",
