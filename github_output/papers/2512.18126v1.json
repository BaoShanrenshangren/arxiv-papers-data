  "abstract": "arXiv:2512.18126v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference can suffer from dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization, which jointly inflate serving latency. We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.",
